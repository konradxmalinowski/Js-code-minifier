# JS Code Minifier

Welcome to **JS Code Minifier** — a fast, lightweight, and open-source web app built with **Vite + React + TypeScript + SCSS** that minifies your JavaScript code instantly

---

## Overview

This app allows developers to paste JavaScript code and get a compressed, minified version with one click. It's privacy-friendly (runs entirely in the browser), easy to use, and optimized for performance.

---

## Tech Stack

-  **React** — Component-based UI
-  **TypeScript** — Type safety
-  **Vite** — Fast dev environment & bundler
-  **SCSS (Sass)** — Modular styling

---

## Features

-  Real-time JS code minification
-  Copy & download functionality
-  Clean and responsive UI
-  All code stays local — nothing is sent to a server
-  Ideal for production-ready scripts
